Music genre classification from audio spectrograms using deep learning
A convolutional neural network is trained with 7000 sample audios of 10 different music genres including blues, jazz, rock, hip hop, classical, and more.
  

  
Our Data set of songs used to train our data: [GTZAN Genre Collection](http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets)  
             
Command:
$python3  get_genre.py  ../filepath 



  
How to run our program: (terminal/command prompt)

$cd  src  
$python3  get_genre.py  ../test.mp3 



(Example Results:) 

	disco: 62.50%  
	rock:  35.42%  
 	reggae: 2.08%  
   



We have a few test songs already in the file but you can use any .mp3 you would like to test your results!
